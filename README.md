## Detailed Explanation

About Project: Loan eligibility prediction using machine learning is a process that uses machine learning and data mining to help predict whether an applicant is likely to repay a loan.

Criteria: Loan Amount, Dependents, Marital Status, Applicant Income, Loan Amount Term, Co-applicant Income, Gender, Credit History, Property Area.

Data science machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) are related fields that all use data, but they have different scopes and goals:

## Data science
A broad field that involves managing, processing, and interpreting big data to extract insights and inform decision-making. Data science can help forecast future trends.
## Machine learning
A subset of data science that uses algorithms to analyze data, learn from it, and make predictions. Machine learning enables computers to learn and make informed guesses based on patterns they've identified. For example, an algorithm called linear regression can predict numerical values based on a linear relationship between different values. 
##AI
A broader field that aims to create intelligent systems that can learn and make decisions, and mimic human intelligence. AI requires a continuous feed of data to learn and improve decision-making. AI can also anticipate user preferences and behavior.
